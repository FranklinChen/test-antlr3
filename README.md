# Test using ANTLR 3.5 with SBT

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/FranklinChen/test-antlr3.png)](https://travis-ci.org/FranklinChen/test-antlr3)

Use the [`sbt-antlr`](https://github.com/stefri/sbt-antlr) plugin.

Note: [SBT 0.13.x is not yet supported by the current release of `sbt-antlr`](https://github.com/stefri/sbt-antlr/issues/7) but there is a [fork that works](git://github.com/Blaisorblade/sbt-antlr#sbt0.13).
